"""The phase module is used to represent material phase. Each element of the
:class:`xrd_simulator.polycrystal.Polycrystal` mesh is linked to a :class:`xrd_simulator.phase.Phase`
describing things like the lattice reference unit cell and generating Miller indices of scattering planes.
By providing a crystalographic information file (.cif) structure factors can be computed.

Here is a minimal example of how to instantiate a Phase object

    Examples:
        .. literalinclude:: examples/example_init_phase.py

`The .cif file used in the above example can be found here.`_

Below follows a detailed description of the Phase class attributes and functions.

    """Defines properties related to a crystal class.

    The barebone Phase object holds the space group name and unit cell of the crystal. From this it is possible
    to compute a set of Miller indices for a given wavelength that can give diffraction. In addition, it is
    possible to compute unit cell structure factors for the hkls which is usefull to model the scattered intensity.
    This will however require a CIF file.

    Args:
        unit_cell (:obj:`list` of :obj:`float`): Crystal unit cell representation of the form
            [a,b,c,alpha,beta,gamma], where alpha,beta and gamma are in units of degrees while
            a,b and c are in units of anstrom.
        sgname (:obj:`string`): Name of space group , e.g 'P3221' for quartz, SiO2, for instance
        path_to_cif_file (:obj:`string`): Path to CIF file. Defaults to None, in which case no structure
            factors are computed, i.e `structure_factors=None`.

            a,b and c are in units of anstrom.

        miller_indices (:obj:`numpy array`): Allowable integer Miller indices (h,k,l) of ``shape=(n,3)``.
        structure_factors (:obj:`numpy array`): Structure factors of allowable Miller indices (```miller_indices```)
            of ``shape=(n,2)``. `structure_factors[i,0]` gives the real structure factor of `hkl=miller_indices[i,:]`
            while `structure_factors[i,0]` gives the corresponding imaginary part of the structure factor.
        path_to_cif_file (:obj:`string`): Path to CIF file.
